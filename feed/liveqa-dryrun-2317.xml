They look like they are split down the middle but I have not caught one of them flying. We have only noticed them these last two summers and my dad seems to think they are caused by a giant weed that looks like s tree growing right up against my house we just haven't had the chance to remove it. Most of them are located right between the wooden door frame and the door which happens to be located right behind the plant. They are found mostly on the walls and ceiling. I've looked up photos of bedbugs hoping that is not what they are and it seems to look like they aren't. Bedbugs have a redish tint to them while these bugs are dark brown/black. Please help me, I have told my dad that we should call pest control but he wants to solve it on his own. I have not been able to take a photo of them this year because my main concern was trying to get rid of them but I have a photo I sent to my dad last summer but it may not let me post it.  Thank you for any information in advance!!</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706082608AAOZyMm</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 09:26:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Home &amp; Garden ] Question: Where can i legally spray paint my things?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706082755AAmcQ98</link><description>I am not asking for graffiti related tips.

I just purchased a used Coleman 424-700 dual fuel camp stove, it says I can use regular gas or coleman fuel.
I was wondering if using AV gas would be better gas to use? Would it burn hotter ie. Could I get more heat from it?
I am curious because the STHIL weedeater I got the guy recommended AV gas because it s cleaner.</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706185753AAtzT5l</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 19:57:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Home &amp; Garden ] Question: Will anthurium bloom again?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706190725AAzsaMN</link><description></description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706190725AAzsaMN</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 20:07:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Home &amp; Garden ] Question: Gardening Experts: Is it okay to plant peonies here?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706192643AAYv54y</link><description>My house faces east.  The south side of my house has a door into a large breezeway, maybe 15 feet wide.  To the south of the breezeway is a two-car attached garage with two separate single garage doors, not one big one, so it's a big garage.  I want to plant peonies along the outside of the south wall of my garage, which gets plenty of sun.

I know peonies attract ants.  Ants are how they pollinate.  But because of they attract ans, people have said I shouldn't plant them along my house.

My question is is that really too close to my house.  I mean, it's right up against my house, but it's the attached garage on the other side of an attached breezeway, both of which are outside rooms.  It's a good 40 to 50 feet from the actual inside of my house.  

Is that too close?  Would I be inviting ants?  Also, my house is limestone.  Would there be an issue of the rocks heating up too much from the direct sun for the peonies? I don't think so because peonies seem to thrive in direct sun and heat, but I just wanted to check. Oh, and when should peonies be planted?  Is it a spring planting or a fall planting or can I do it now?</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706192643AAYv54y</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 20:26:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Travel ] Question: Can I use a 17 inch laptop on airplane tray?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706193016AAo6p9u</link><description>I have a gaming 17 inch laptop and I was wondering if I can use it while travelling on a plane using seat tray.

"'business-appropriate' clothing is acceptableand encouraged. For men, such clothing includes collared-dress shirts, khaki-type slacks, closed-toe shoes, and socks.  Unacceptable attire includes denim, sports logo wear, athletic or 'athleisure' clothing such as leggings, golf/polo shirts, capri pants, sandals, miniskirts, or other revealing clothing."

I'm concerned the rivets and pockets of these pants might not fit the criteria.  However, I think when I wear a nice button down shirt, belt, and dress shoes it will look good.  Please help.

I would get a cage for it to go in when I'm not not (for school or work) and night but when I'm home it would be able to run around in the "fence" I would buy. I would make sure it had at least two hours a day of being able to run around. I also have two dogs and a cat but the dogs would never be alone with it even when it's in the cage. No small children in the house. We're all over 13 and I would do my research to make sure it had the proper food and toys and such but I just want to know if it would be okay with being in the cage. It would be given attention and I'd litter train it. Also would get it fixed when the times comes. Would it be okay?

It's strange that Australia went that route because after WW2 the UK became more socialist. The first elected government after the Second World War introduced the NHS (National Health Service) largely as a way to make sure everyone who fought in the war and the families who were affected had free access to the health care that they required. Australia didn't really do a lot of fighting in the war and were relatively unharmed so the need for free health care probably wasn't as pressing for them.

Despite claiming to be economically liberal, the Liberal Party has introduced more protectionist policies and interventionism than any other government in Australia and are fervently conservative in social aspects. It was the ALP that started TPP negotiations that would have potentially liberated trade between some of the largest world markets.

Despite the Liberal's best efforts to restrict socialism, socialist healthcare was introduced in Australia in 1975. It was called Medibank initially but is now known as Medicare, and has near universal approval. This  not only helped Australians at home but also abroad because it lead to Reciprocal Health Care Agreements with the United Kingdom and ten other countries entitling Australian residents to reciprocal free health care rights while in one of these countries.

In short, the Liberals are not liberal.</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706230904AA7dziU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:09:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Pets ] Question: Dog peeing for several minutes to an hour?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706230942AAdtjTe</link><description>the other day, my friends dog (around 11 years old believe) started peeing inside so they let him in and i guess he wad either on and off peeing or straight peeing for several minutes. they let him back inside about 40 minutes later and he was still peeing ? he hasnt done thus since. the reason im asking is because my friends parents are tight w money, getting asked to leave their place and movin to another. i cannot myself afford to take him to the vet either. has anybody have a clue on what this could be ?? and anyway we can help at home ?</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706230942AAdtjTe</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:09:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Travel ] Question: Do they have ATM in Iquitos,Peru?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706231118AAdDkvh</link><description></description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706231118AAdDkvh</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:11:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Home &amp; Garden ] Question: Are Beefsteak tomatoes determinant and if so what will happen if I pruned it?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706231317AAj7ILA</link><description></description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706231317AAj7ILA</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:13:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Pets ] Question: Why does my kitten scratch at my bedroom door at night when I'm trying to sleep?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170706231718AAgIe50</link><description>He also whines and cries too.

I was swimming with friends and family in an indoor swimming pool. I had just jumped in and been submerged for a few seconds. I had only gone down a foot or two. Nothing unusual about the descent or ascent until I emerged to breathe and couldn't. I may as well have been trying to breathe water, the air felt so dense and my lungs felt so small. Through much gasping and sputtering (which caught no one's attention amazingly) I managed to grasp the pool ledge and get my breathing back to normal.
I always thought it might've been the Benz and when I ask the people who were there they don't remember what I'm referring to.

(suicidal)?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170707011228AA6WW1t</link><description>long story short I am a dancer. I never had this problem up until about 2 years ago(I m 20 yr old male now) . 
its really not a problem until I start to sweat extremely-in long tense rehearsals that last for more than 2 hrs.
p.s I been through puberty. 12

I understand its the bacteria that comes in when the skin is soaked with sweat which makes sense because after I stop activity for a bit I smell fine including the clothes I take off.

my daily routine ever since this problem: at night I wash (dove soap), put clinical deodorant (dove) on I wake up stretch( in which I sweat get in the shower and put good quality deodorant on (dove). I tried different deodorants that are not like powder doesn t work for me

this caused so much stress on my life I literally had suicidal thoughts cause of some of the bullying. I became a vegetarian for several months. and recently I stopped eating sugar for days. because it came out of no where. I m seeing a doctor soon I honestly feel helpless and I just don t know... my life is dark rn.
can any of you help? products? doing something wrong? Is there a way I can lessen the bacteria and or sweat. I don t want to lose opportunities because of this</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170707011228AA6WW1t</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:12:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Arts &amp; Humanities ] Question: Have you read Les Miserables or Moby Dick?

this is Tim. I just start my business in residential remodeling. my first client would like to do the following stuff:

bathroom remodel: 5ft*11ft bathroom

take out the bathtub. put concrete on the ground to build a shower. replace faucet inside the shower and build a "chair" inside. add a two level shower soap dish "inside" the wall. 

replace a new toilet, install a new outlet next to the toilet, replace vanity, install a new light and a fan on top of the shower.

tile the entire bathroom, including wall, floor, total 270ft.

how much should I charge for this project? only labor, customer buy material. I am in atlanta btw.

looking forward to hear from any professional contractor. thanks so much~!!!</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170707014443AA0Nckd</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:44:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Sports ] Question: Is Russ Smith going to make the NBA?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170707014618AAkSJAg</link><description>He's putting up big numbers on a daily basis</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170707014618AAkSJAg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:46:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Sports ] Question: Attempting to start a business predicting point spreads for football.

I want to quit basketball and really focus on volleyball, but I don't want to make the coaches, the team, or my parents mad. My dad is constantly getting on me about practicing basketball outside of practice, but when it comes to volleyball, just tells me that what we do in practice is fine and doesn't push me to practice outside of school practice.

She found out she had OCD and finally felt free from her fears until she was given immortality and gained a supernatural gift to go with it. 

At first I thought of giving her a gift that with one touch she could heal all mental or psychical illnesses and make people extremely. Her hands could also push away attacks from others and sense danger. 

I like that gift, but I think I want to give her a little more conflict then that. I want her gift to be very dark and harmful, and she fears it and refuses to use it, but struggles to control it at times. Kind of like frozen with Elsa's power, but I don't want her to have ice powers.

I'm soon to be 18 and still in high school and going to live with my patents until after college (Gonna be a vet tech). I've had rabbits before when I was younger but none for a few years. I would get a cage for it to go in when I'm not not (for school or work) and night but when I'm home it would be able to run around in the "fence" I would buy. The cage would not be a tiny one it would have enough room to lay down and it would be tall enough for it to stand up. I would make sure it had at least two hours a day of being able to run around. It would have as much as possible like all night after school if I don't work and also much of the time on the weekends and also if my brothers decide to play with it if they want when I'm not home. I also have two dogs and a cat but the dogs would never be alone with it even when it's in the cage. No small children in the house. We're all over 13 and I would do my research to make sure it had the proper food and toys and such but I just want to know if it would be okay with being in the cage. It would be given attention and I'd litter train it. Also would get it fixed when the times comes. I'm also up for recommendations on what to get and some tips on care. It would be more than a month before I get it so I have plenty of time to prepare.  Would it be okay?

I would love to hear your answer in a one succinct paragraph?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718044331AAC05vh</link><description>Two people return to their long neglected garden and find among the weeds a few of the old plants surprisingly vigorous. One says to the other, "It must be that a gardener has been coming and doing something about these plants.&#8221; Upon inquiry they find that no neighbor has ever seen anyone at work in their garden. The first man says to the other, "He must have worked while people slept." The other says, "No, someone would have heard him and besides, anybody who cared about the plants would have kept down these weeds." The first man says, "Look at the way these are arranged. There is purpose and a feeling for beauty here. I believe that someone comes, someone invisible to mortal eyes. I believe that the more carefully we look the more we shall find confirmation of this." 
They examine the garden ever so carefully and sometimes they come on new things suggesting that a gardener comes and sometimes they come on new things suggesting the contrary and even that a malicious person has been at work. Besides examining the garden carefully, they also study what happens to gardens left without attention. Each learns all the other learns about this and about the garden. 
Consequently, when after all this, one says, "I still believe a gardener comes," while the other says, "I don't,"

My boyfriend has had a couple of pets killed by cars, and now as a result he moves roadkill animals off the road so no pet owner has to deal with the headache of scraping their pet off the pavement the way he has. However when he got out to move this kitty he was still alive. Unable to afford the vet bill, we took him to the overnight drop box at out local shelter and came back to see if he made it the next day. Now a week later he's bounced back and can walk, run,  jump, and eat on his own. The girls at the shelter have been asking us about adopting him and we think it's a lovely idea. However, the damage done to him after getting hit has left him with a head tilt. Because of this we've affectionately given him the name Wybie, after the little boy from the movie Coraline who walk around with his head tilted to the side like our kitty. He can walk, run, and jump, but he can't do it straight. How can we care for our little Wybie the best we can given his disability?</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718052958AAeATAC</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 06:29:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Health ] Question: Will my four day period get longer when I start birth control?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718053013AAyfF5i</link><description>I'm starting bc pills pretty soon and I'm aware of what could happen to me but I was thinking because the sugar pills is 7 days would my period be 7 days ifs it's four while I'm not on the pill?</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718053013AAyfF5i</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 06:30:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Health ] Question: I have no motivation and it is destroying my life.?</title><link>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718053036AAWyRSW</link><description>I can't find the motivation to do anything. I'm 21 years old, and I work as a bus Person at a restaurant 30 hours a week. I've had the owner of a car business tell me that I can call him whenever I want if I want work, and I can never motivate myself to call him. I can't even motivate myself to do my laundry or clean my apartment half the time. All I ever want to do is drink, play video games. I've lost interest in guitar playing, one of my strings broke and I can't bring myself to drive to the music store and buy new strings, the only thing I ever spend my money on is beer almost every night. My dad rides me all the time about how I never do anything except drink and sit on the computer. I realize that these are all problems but I can't bring myself to fix them. My dad thinks it's just because I'm a lazy piece of you know what. I told him the I would kill him, and of course I didn't actually mean it, I was just mad at the time I don't actually want to kill him and he pretty much resents me now. He told me that if my other 2 brothers stopped talking to him it would bother him, but if I stopped talking to him it wouldn't bother him one bit. I don't think it's because I'm lazy I think they're more deep rooted issues that are going on with me, and I don't know what to do. I'm considering seeking professional help, I don't know whether to do outpatient therapy or impatient.

I'm a little chubbier then I want to be so I started to try to diet. I never really knew how many calories I was consuming but I tried to do a 1,100 calorie diet with low carbs (and I guess fat as well) I've been using the app myfitnesspal to track my foods for the days. So far, I have lost 6 pounds however I'm not seeing much changes in my body. The real problem here is I have a limit (on the app) of 97g of carbs a day and 37g of fat a day. I'm doing good with my protein and staying under these is just fine for me. However, I'm not reaching my 1,100 calories for the day !! I thought it would be hard to consume so little calories but turns out I'm not getting enough. I don't think this is healthy to consume too little and I'm afraid I'm going to start losing body fat. I'm also a vegetarian so what should I do?? Are the amount of carbs and fat I'm getting a day healthy as well?

You have had many procedures and several operations to repair the damage to the point where it is now just a useless painful "ball" in your sac. You are on pain medication which works most of the time but you will always regret lifting something heavy, most exercises, and all  but very gentle sex.The only thing left is to have it removed BUT the doctors give you a 50/50 chance that the pain will continue as "ghost pain" and nothing further could be done. Would you have a painful testicle removed if you will have a 50% chance that the pain would still be there? 
After 4 failed operations and numerous procedures would you still do it knowing your chances of pain relief are nothing better than a role of the dice, that ghost pains would still cripple you, or

I had my gallbladder removed about four years ago, and ever since then, I ve had to go to the bathroom urgently and do my business (which usually ends up in small amounts of diarrhea). Even now, right after eating, or even in the middle of eating, I get the urge to go, and when I do it s a small amount of diarrhea.

I do not have any abdominal pain, fever, or any other symptoms. It doesn t matter what I eat, everything makes me feel this way. I do not take laxatives, I m not allergic to anything, and do not have any other symptoms besides what I stated before. Should I go to a doctor, or is an uncommon side effect that I shouldn t worry about? Are there any ideas how I can lighten the frequency, or make it stop altogether?

Side note - I do have "solid" bathroom trips, but only when I eat a lot of meat. Not sure if that helps or not.

To begin my dreams of living in Japan, I thought about starting off as a host at a host club. In Japan, it's not uncommon for Japanese women to pay guys huge sums of money for a couple of cocktails and a few hours of platonic companionship. The key is to be attractive, and to lure in women. I think I have an advantage because I'm foreign. However, to be honest, I'm not the greatest at picking up women because I'm introverted, but I could still make it possible for women to enjoy my presence, since I never had trouble in that area. A description about myself, I'm half French and half Mexican, so I have black hair, but somewhat tanned skin (hazel eyes). I have a swimmer's built, and quite skinny, but I have good muscular definition. I have a youthful face, so I look younger than my real age. As for my overall appearance towards women, I have had two or three random women come to my job just to see me in the past. Anyways, it's not an ideal job (hosting and all), but I think it's better than the other typical jobs as a foreigner (like teaching English to a classroom full of people).</description><guid>https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20170718055829AA5Rk6s</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 06:58:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[ Health ] Question: One side of my jaw is bigger than the other.

Now that I am older, I know it is important to socialize with people for networking and things. I am a college student and I just don't know how to get over this anxiety that I have. Stepping out of my comfort zone has always scared me. Whenever someone wants to hang out with me , I would just not respond or just make up an excuse as to why I can't hang out with them... There are 2 people that I can hang out with that I do not have anxiety with but one of them has a boyfriend and the other is busy doing other things. We do hang out sometimes. It is just hard for me to get involved with the general public and socialize. I am afraid I'll have panic attacks and I get really offended easily by some people and the things they might say even if it's not meant to be offensive, I get very defensive.

My question is this, she was in the ER for 12 hours before she was even seen by the general surgeon and then he wasn&amp;apos;t convinced that it was this condition yet.  He said that he&amp;apos;d check on her in the morning once she was finally put into an ICU room (this was at 11 p.m.).  I last spoke to her at midnight that evening and that was the last time that she was conscious.  By the time she got to the ICU just 2-3 hours later, she was unresponsive and put on life support.  Surgery was eventually performed later that afternoon and 90% of her small intestine had to be removed.  She died early the next evening.  My question to you is did they wait too long to do anything for her?  Could she have been saved if surgery had been done sooner?

Hi, I was wondering if blood clotting assays are always positive if one has mild-moderate hemophilia and what the name is of the genetic tests for hemophilia? I have a history of internal spontaneous bleeding into the joints or with eating garlic or onions (in large amounts).I also hemmorhage after injuries (arm injury, head injury hemmorhage, and pregnancy birth hemmorhage--both times).  I&amp;apos;ve had to have blood transfusions and shots to control the bleeding but it&amp;apos;s usually possible to control it. I believe I may have passed this on to my son as he was determined by a doctor to be a heavy bleeder at circumcision. While on the [LOCATION]t, I was asked by a [LOCATION] if anyone had done a work-up on me for hemophilia or any clotting disorder and I said not to my knowledge.  I asked if they were going to do it and she said to follow up with a primary doctor for it.  She also said it could be expensive. This is why I&amp;apos;m asking, if I go to a medical appointment as a private-pay patient, and want to have testing done, which tests would you recommend?

I was suffering from social anxiety since I was child.  Last year, I decided to go to a psychologist. She advised me to practice meditation, mindfulness and CBT as well.  She explained to me the great positive impact of the meditation, mindfulness on the brain activity (neuroplasticity). Since then, I&amp;apos;ve been practicing these techniques. The result was awesome. I no longer suffer from my social anxiety and my life has completely changed to the positive side. No more worry, stress, anxiety, etc.  But at the same time, I started to suffer from chronic insomnia until now. Of course, Im always in touch with my psychiatrist who has prescribed me the necessary and still following me up. Even tough, my insomnia doesn&amp;apos;t improved.  Unfortunately, nobody can determine the real cause of my insomnia.  If I know the cause, I&amp;apos;ll do my best to find the key to resolve this problem.  According to my mentioned story, can you help me to find the real cause of my insomnia?   Thank you, Your answer is very appreciable and important to me.
